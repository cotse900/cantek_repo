# DVD RENTAL SQL PROJECT

- This SQL project is on various tables about an online DVD rental system: category, film_category, film, language, film_actor, actor, staff, store, payment, rental, inventory, customer, address, city, and country. In my work, I did a few queries using different techniques. We can explore things like patterns of rentals, film trends, synopses, and rental costs. Here is an entity relationship diagram:

- In this project, I used postgreSQL 16rc1 and pgadmin4 7.6 (Win).

1. To find the cast of a film called "Chamber Italian"
2. To know the filmography of an actor called Alec Wayne
3. To find out the number of DVD customers by country in each store
